Double tap the same key to disable a parameter (if available).</li><li>Searching for a number in the piece selection panel allows you to place the respective Constant: Number piece directly from there.</li><li>Spell name field is no longer force selected (no more v spam for direwolf :<).</li><li>Tab changes your cursor between the text box and the spell grid.</li><li>The arrow keys can be used to change the selected position.</li><li>You can search for "in:(type)" or "out:(type)" to get pieces that take a specific data type as input or have it as output.</li><li><i>(If you're on Mac, use Cmd instead of Ctrl).</i></li></ul>
